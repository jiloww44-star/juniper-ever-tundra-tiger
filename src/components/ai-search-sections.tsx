              LLMO measurement typically involves probing LLMs at scale, logging responses and
              processing brand mentions. Done naively that creates Nigeria Data Protection Act
              exposure — personal data in prompts and responses — and global AI governance standards
              / ISO 42001 questions for clients using AI features in-product. BeameAI by LOGON
              designs the measurement pipeline so probes are anonymized, response logs are
              pseudonymized, and any in-product AI features referenced in citation content align
              with continental and international transparency obligations. Where clients serve
              European markets, EU AI Act transparency requirements are mapped as well.

              For African consultancies specifically, the LLM opportunity is asymmetric: LLMs
              under-cite African experts because the training data is US-heavy. Deliberate LLMO
              investment closes that gap fast, and being cited as "the African authority on X"
              compounds because LLMs re-rank you upward in future responses.

            per day, and buyers increasingly ask AI before visiting websites. When someone asks

              Brands cited today train the next version of every AI model. Early LLMO investment
              creates a self-reinforcing authority signal that becomes harder for competitors to
              displace over time. The brands that establish AI search presence in 2025–2026 will
              dominate AI-generated recommendations for years. At BeameAI by LOGON, we've seen
              clients go from zero AI citations to consistent mentions across ChatGPT, Perplexity
              and Google AI Overviews within 90 days. The window for first-mover advantage in your
              category is still open — but not for long.
